# Introduction and Preparations

My computer OS is Win10 X64 version number 1809.

My Windows Subsystem for Linux is Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.

```uname -r```: 4.4.0-17763-Microsoft

## [Installing Ruby](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/preparations#installingruby)

First, I followed the tutorials to install Ruby on Windows by using **RubyInstaller**.

However, I found that some exercises need to be done in **CLI**(Command line interface).

After looking around the existing solutions, I finally tried the WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux ) as my workshop.

 	After l learnt more about the command line in the book (Introduction to the Command Line), I understand the difference between the Terminal Emulators and shell. One of the famous Terminal Emulators in Win10 is Cmder. Among many shells, I think Z shell is my favourite command interpreter.
